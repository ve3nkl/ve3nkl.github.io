  <h1>Wearable Sattelite Station</h1>
  <p>This satellite station was built to work SSB satellites. From the very
  beginning I wanted to have a “wearable” station, the one where you would
  not require any surfaces to put the radios on or a tripod to mount the
  antenna. The frequency would have to be adjusted manually - no computers.</p>
  <p>As the two radios I have are Yaesu FT-817ND and Elecraft KX3 with the
  2m option installed, my initial thought was to put both radios in a single
  bag that could be worn using a shoulder strap. The Arrow antenna could be
  hand held, of cause. Unfortunately, this simple design did not work for me
  very well. Having the two radios really close together caused
  desense in the receiver when the other radio was transmitting.</p>
  <p>This issue was not difficult to resolve: the Elecraft radio remained in
  the bag but the Yaesu was moved on my other shoulder. In fact, now I could
  use a smaller bag for the Elecraft rig.</p>
  <div class="image" style="width: 550px;"><img src="ws-two-radios.jpg"/></div>
  <p>On the picture above you can see both radios. Yaesu FT-817ND has a spacer
  made of PVC fittings attached to it. Its purpose is to provide some space
  between the controls and the body so that the controls are not altered
  accidentally. You can also see a morse code Pico Paddle from Palm Radio
  attached to the Yeasu rig. Although it is not visible very well on the picture
  but there is a voice recorder located between the Elecraft rig and the body.</p>
  <p>This recorder has a very useful feature. You can monitor your audio being
  recorded. The input of the recorder is connected to the phone output of the
  receive radio and the output goes to the head phones. The recorder won’t
  provide any output unless it is in the recording mode. If you can hear the
  signal in your phones it means it is being recorded. This way I cannot simply
  forget to press the “record” button…</p>
  <p>When I tried to use this setup I found another problem: I have only two hands.
  Not that I never noticed this before, but I have never felt such a desperate
  need for the third one. It would be really great to be able to fine-turn your
  frequency during the transmit. But pressing the PTT button, turning the
  frequency nob and holding the antenna with only two hands is a great challenge.</p>
  <p>The solution came in the form of an external PTT button mounted on the Arrow boom,
  right next to the handle.</p>
  <div class="image" style="width: 150px;"><img src="ws-ptt-button.jpg"/></div>
  <p>It was made of a PVC tube cap and a metal angle piece left from assembling
  a furniture (why there are always extra parts left ?). I shaped it to serve as
  a brace. A glue gun was used to keep in place a micro button inserted in the
  opening of the PVC cap.</p>
  <p>When I work a Satellite having its uplink on UHF and its downlink on VHF, I
  have to connect the mic and the PTT button to the Yaesu rig and the phones to
  the Elecraft rig (in fact, there is also a voice recorder in between). Now consider
  this: I am using a Heil Sound headset with a two-pin connector for an ICOM handheld
  radios, a Yeasu rig, an Elecraft rig and a homebrew PTT button. To connect all my
  zoo together I had to use a small interface box (another homebrew project) shown in
  the picture below.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The blue plug (made of a piece of an old Ethernet cable) is connected to the
  Yaesu RJ-45 mic socket. The light green audio plug is for the phones socket (in
  my case I connect it to the output of the voice recorder). The single socket on
  the left picture is for a cable coming from my PTT button and the two sockets on
  the right picture are compatible with the double-pin ICOM audio standard (for my
  Heil Sound headset). Neddless to say that when I tried my design for the first time 
  there was no incoming audio from the mic. Spending an hour with the Yaesu schematics
  helped me to come up with an idea of inserting an additional resistor to match the
  input Yaesu circuit properly. It worked ! Just in case you are interested in more
  details here is the schematics of my interface box:</p>
  <div class="image" style="width: 640px;"><img src="ws-schematics.png"/></div>
  <p>One tiny detail left to be told. The Heil Sound headset I am using has its own
  PTT button on its cable. Even though my PTT puts Yaesu in the TX mode, the audio
  from the headset mic won’t come in unless the headset’s PTT button is also depressed.
  So in order to work properly this headset’s PTT button have to be kept in the pushed
  down position. As usual, PVC tubes come to the rescue…</p>

  <p>A cut in the piece of tube is done to create a spring action. A small piece of
  soft plastic (it was part of a mirror mounting kit) is used to press on the PTT
  button.</p>
